# Casino Project (Blackjack and Roulette)

Each game, and its functionality is controlled using external buttons, and the 
data is transferred through an EEPROM. Our home screen presents a welcome message along with 
your options for which games to play. Upon selection of a game, we enter the gameâ€™s functionality. 
For roulette, the user picks a bet, (Red, Black, Even, Odd, or a number), and then submits it. The 
dealer spins a wheel to generate the number, and lets you know if your bet has won or lost. Again, 
this is all done through EEPROM and external buttons. Our blackjack game allows you to play a 
hand, see the dealers first card, and then decide whether or not you want to hit or stand. Once you 
either bust or stand, the dealer will play out the rest of the hand and let you know if you have won or 
lost.
